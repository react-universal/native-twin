# Next.js

## Installation

This lib can be used in a Next.js project that is already configured to use Expo or vanilla React Native Web, the configuration will be the same as using react native web for nextjs or just nextjs without react native.

We dont use any babel plugin or swc special config so there is nothing more to do.

### Setup tailwind CSS
