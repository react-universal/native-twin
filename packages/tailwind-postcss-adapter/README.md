## Postcss and tailwindcss plugin adapter for react-native

This package is used for internal testing purposes use at your own risk.

Mainly this package was the core of the react-native tailwind integration but the time spend on postcss operations is massive and takes around `300ms~` in transform the tailwind utilities, in the most recent version we use a modded version of twind to accomplish this and also support an advanced syntax from twind.
