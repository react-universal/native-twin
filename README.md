      <p>React UniversalLabs simplifies the integration of Tailwind CSS framework in React Native hybrid apps. Our main goal is to bridge the gap for React web developers in need to write universal components for native and web. <br/> 
      This package allows developers to write Tailwind CSS classes with all states (active, hover, focus) that just works and looks as expected in native.</p>

This library is heavily inspired in **nativewind** transforming CSS-to-JS, but without the use of **Babel** or **Tailwind CLI**, instead this lib uses **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** itself and **[PostCSS](https://postcss.org/)** in the runtime. 

**PostCSS** runs only on react-native Tailwind is bundled into the core package (this idea was readapted from **tw-to-css** lib), for web we uses **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** and **[PostCSS](https://postcss.org/)** just like any react project, but you need to use our styled components or create your own styled components using the styled lib.
